This is Rui's data challenge submission.

My code is in `/insightDataChallenge/pharmacy_counting-master/src/phamacy_counting.py`

I used Python 2 to process the data. The library I used include

sys, StringIO and csv

There are three function in my code

`loaddata` will load the data from input file

`processData` will read the data and summarizing data

`outputData` will write processed data to output file

To run the code, put the standard data in `/phamacy_counting-master/input/`

and run ./run_test.sh under dir `/phamacy_counting-master/insight_testsuite/`
